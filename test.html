We present a novel deep learning approach for category-agnostic 6D object pose tracking. Unlike category-specific approaches, our method requires no CAD models or annotated keypoints of the objects to track their pose. We tackle 6D object pose tracking as an unsupervised 3D keypoint prediction and matching. We represent a target object using 3D point clouds and separate these 3D points into clusters to estimate the 3D keypoint from each cluster, which improves the efficiency of keypoints prediction. The inter-frame change of 6D pose can be obtained by matching keypoints between the previous and current frame, which enables 6D pose tracking. Our cluster-based keypoint prediction dose not require prior knowledge of categories, allows category-agnostic 6D pose tracking. We evaluate our method on the NOCS dataset by comparing ours with state-of-the-art methods.
